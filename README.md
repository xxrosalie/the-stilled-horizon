# The Stilled Horizon
The Stilled Horizon is a set of 4 video games created by Rosalie Rutten, Aaron Green, and Jason Nguyen. The games all play in the same narrative. Game 1 starts the story and game 4 ends it. Game 1 is a narrative game, game 2 is a hidden object game, game 3 is a pinball game, and game 4 is a point-and-click RPG. With the limitations of what type of game each game had to be, we had to make sure the narrative fit within all these games.    

## Credits 
- Code: Jason Nguyen and Aaron Green  
- Art: Rosalie Rutten
    I designed and drew all of the art you see in any of the games. I drew scenes for game 1, scenes, objects, and UIs for game 2, scenes, characters, objects, and     UI's for game 3, and tilemaps, characters, and objects for game 4.

## The Story
You enter a city where the city is frozen in time and the people are aimlessly living. You must decide who to build a relationship with between the remaining unfrozen people and decide between living rebellious or saving the city.

## Game 1
Game 1 is where the story starts. It is a narrative game made on Inky. It sets the story up, introduces the characters, and ends with the decision of who to join: the good side or the bad side. Whatever decision you are able to make depends on the amount of relationship points you have built with each side. If you have more relationship points with the bad side, you lose the game and must try again, since the true ending of game 1 is joining the good side.

## Game 2
Game 2 is the hidden object game. At the end of game 1, you joined the good side and decide to go to the bad guy's house to steal back parts of the time machine that he took. So, in this hidden object game, we break into the bad guy's house and find the parts that he stole. You have 5 minutes and 3 rooms to look through. There are also some puzzles hidden within.

## Game 3
Game 3 comes right after you take back the parts that the bad guy stole. You are now trying to escape his house since he comes home at the end of the 5 minutes. This is the pinball game where you are trying to escape and dodge the bad guy's following you.  You can get powerups throughout the game and there is a "timer" at the bottom of the screen showing you how far you are from escaping. If you reach it to the end before the bad guy's catch you, you win.

## Game 4
Game 4 is the resolution. You made it back to the lab after escaping the bad guys and now you have the parts of the time machine. It is now time to fix the time machine and unfreeze time.
